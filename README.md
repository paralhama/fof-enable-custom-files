### This plugin is an essential tool for Fistful of Frags server administrators that have custom files!
It automatically configures the necessary settings for players to download custom files, such as skins and other exclusive server content.
When a player joins the server, the plugin checks if their settings for automatic downloads are correct. If not, it adjusts them automatically and notifies the player to restart their game.

The plugin detects messages in the chat about download issues or missing custom files.
Since the automatic configuration might fail for some players, it provides clear and detailed instructions to help them resolve the issue manually.

Remember that you can customize any message by editing the translation file or anything else in the plugin. 
In my case, I created a mod in the Steam Workshop to allow players to manually download the custom files for my server. 
You can also use and modify the webpage included in this plugin to direct players to a page that will help resolve any issues on your server.
